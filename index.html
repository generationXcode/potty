        <h2>what is this?</h2>
        <p>This is POTTY, and we make chatbots! we work hard to provide you with bots with different personalities.
        We make them alive!these bots learn from you customize your chat in that way for the period of time you talk to it</p>
        <br>
        <h2>how to use them?</h2>
        <br>
        <p>that is for you to figure out.You can use these to practice conversing with someone before you actually do it.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>how do these bots work?</h2><br>
        <p>These bots are pre proggrammed(is the spelling right?)to give you an awseome beginning to your chat, they continue by learning from what you say to them and customize the chat accordingly.Once you are done and you exit the page, the chatbot forgets whatever you say so, none of what you say is used as data future chats.This forgetting of what you say can also help you restart your conversation and make your role play better if your conversation went in the wrong track.</p>
